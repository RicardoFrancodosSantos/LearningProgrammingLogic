 **Suggest a number - Write an application that , in the initialization, is generated a random value  beetween 1 to 10 and allows user  suggest a number until the random number generated in the beggining of the program will suggested correctly.**

The program must inform that if the suggestion was above, below or equals compared  with the number generated in  the beggining of the program

1. step by step
	1. User enter in application
	2. User click “Start”
	3. application generate random number beetween 1 and 10
	4. application storage the generated number
	5. ask to person input the suggested number
	6. person insert a number
	7. application process and storage the suggested number
	8. application compare the suggested number with the generated number
	9. application shows if the suggestion was above, below or equal  compared  with the number generated in  the beggining of the program
	10. if the suggestion was greater than the generate number, shows to the user the message ““high suggestion!”  andapplication asks to input a new suggested number, 
	11. if the suggestion was lower than the generate number, shows to the user the message ““lower suggestion
	!”  andapplication asks to input a new suggested number,
	12. application continues in the loop until the number matches


Conditionals
1. Number must be beetween 1 to 10
2. 10 and 11 


**Problem 4 - Welcome generator**

Make a program that asks to user his name and after says  welcome, saying  “X welcome”, where “x” is the user name



1.User name
2. after  i receive the user name, i need to infrome a message with the user_name _ welcome
3. user name must be provided
4. says “x welcome” where where “x” is the user name
5.  x = user_name
	1.  input  = user_name
	2. print = user_name + “welcome”
6.


input
print
if
else
loop de x a y
loop de x em y
while x

1 = input = user_name
2. devo receber o nome do usuario e mostrar na tela uma mensagem com o nome do usuario+ seja bem vindo
x = user_name

print = “x +”seja bem vindo”” 



**Problem 5- The greatest beetween two numbers

Build a program that  receive two values and shows the greatest beetween then

1. Value_1 and Value_2
2. after i receive the two values, i need to compare Value_1 with Value_2 and show the greatest number beetween the two values
3. i need to receive the two values to allow the comparison
4. prinr the greatest value beetween the two values

Input 1  = Value_1
Input 2 = Value_2

PrintGreatestValue =  if Value_1 > Value 2  then print “Value_1 is greateast”

 if Value_1 < Value 2  then print “Value_2 is greatest”

else
Print “ Value_1 is equals Value_2”


Problem 6- Factorial of a number 
1. Which are all necessary data inputs?
	1. an integer number.      input = number
2. What i need to do with this data?
	1. Create a program that receive a number and print his fatorial. after receive the number, the program needs to multiply the number by all his antecessors and print the result
3. Which are all restrictions of this problem?
the program can`t allow receive vallues different than a positive integer number
4. Which is the expected result?
create a number that receive an integer and positive number and print his fatorial
5. Which are the step sequence to achieve the expected result?

1. input integer_number

if integer_number < 0
 print ˜input only positive number˜
 
 fatorial = 1
fatorial = fatorial * integer_number
  print fatorial

Problem 7- Sum values of a list and print the 

Given a collection of data called ages, with the values 15, 46, 75, 34, and 23, print the sum of these values on the screen.

1. Which are all necessary data inputs?
ages = [15,46,75,34, 23]
